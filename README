Leif Let Live

This is an extra credit game for the class Jour 1501 which I designed
over the course of about two weeks during classes, but then programmed
in the space of one night. As such, it is by no means, of any sort, of good
quality.

It has been slowly downgraded from the original design which actually
intended to be built using the game engine Unity. Now, I debated whether
I had enough time to use ncurses. (At the time of this writing, that is
still up for debate... it is currently 1:54 AM... I have a test at 9:45 AM)


Leif Let Live is a simple roguelike which tells the story of Leif, a wary
peasant distraught with his dead ash stricken land. The land, over endless
years, has been ravaged by the evil dragon Oboros (Ouroboros ;)). 

The dragon set its fiery reign upon the land the day it killed the ancient 
king Leif, and stole his crown. The crown has a few names... The Leaf Crown,
The Crown of Life, and sometimes The Crown of Leif. It is no matter what 
legends call the great crown though; what matters is that present day Leif 
is in search of the crown. He believes, according to the legends, that the 
crown, if recovered from Oboros, will bring Spring back to the ash-duned 
land.

Now, after an arduous journey, the only thing left standing between Leif and
Oboros is a vile, crawling, dank dungeon. It is full of great wonders,
people, and treasures. But, deadly traps, monsters, and nightmares also
inhabit its halls. The woeful blood stains and cobwebbed treasure piles of
the dead speak of stories begun like yours yet ended violently. Will Leif be
triumphant by your guide, or will his fate be as gruesome as the legends 
which preceded him?

His life is in your hands. May Spring come again.
